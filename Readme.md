## Aerial Installed by default with project.

If you only want Aerial as a screensaver without the desktop change, simply open **Uninstall.app**<br>
and you are done! The afterward uninstall steps are for removing the Aerial Screensaver.

To find more information on Aerial navigate to:
https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial<br><hr>

## Note:

The screensaver engine takes your default screensaver to project as a desktop background.<br>
